1) Jfrog Artifactory
2) Jfrog Xray Scan


Then you tell me what you undertood, and what is advantage of it

apt install maven
apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
java -jar target/*.jar

Above code can we devided into 2 categary:

1) Infrastucture setup
        apt install maven
        apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless

2) Application deployment
        git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
        cd spring-petclinic
        ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
        java -jar target/*.jar


 docker run -idt -p 8080:8080 2020ht66049/application:zursayume


Above steps are supporting 100 user, and my requirement is 200, then I need to add 1 more server. but before I add I need run step 1 and step2 on that 
server which is causing delay of appox 10 minutes

To resolve this we have some good approache-

1) Golden image
2) Jfrog Artifactory


Artifactory means:it is a place where we store the artifact to run our application to avoid similar activity by multiple user.

GIT hub vs articatory
=====================
1) GIThub has a size limit object more the 50 MB are not allowed.
2) it only meant for text data.

WORA: Write once run anywhere

Devops Promotes WORA concepts, so similar activity can be avoided
