1) Jfrog Artifactory
2) Jfrog Xray Scan


Then you tell me what you undertood, and what is advantage of it

apt install maven
apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
java -jar target/*.jar

Above code can we devided into 2 categary:

1) Infrastucture setup
        apt install maven
        apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless

2) Application deployment
        git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
        cd spring-petclinic
        ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
        java -jar target/*.jar

Above steps are supporting 100 user, and my requirement is 200, then I need to add 1 more server. but before I add I need run step 1 and step2 on that 
server which is causing delay of appox 10 minutes

To resolve this we have some good approache-

1) Golden image
2) Jfrog Artifactory

loginid: github login id
passwd: github password

Exacize: login to server and run below command
docker run 2020ht66049/image1:zursay
