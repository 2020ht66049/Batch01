Docker
======
>>> Whenever we are getting any instruction to deploy application, development team specify the dependancy-

Example: 
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar

Petclinic is a Spring Boot application built using Maven or Gradle. You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 17 or newer):


So, when we setup the environment we need to install those dependancies

ubuntu
apt-get update
apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
java -jar target/*.jar

Writing docker file rule:
=========================
1) The instruction should be from <OS-name> where you want to deploy the application
      FROM ubuntu, centos, alpine
      from ubuntu
      from centos
      from aline

2) I want to print some message on linux terminal
      command: echo "Message"
      Docker-Command-keyword echo messase

Dockerfile
==========
It contains set of instruction to create docker image

How to create docker image?
==========================
docker build -t imagename .

How to run docker image
=======================
docker run imagename  

Docker-Command-keyword
======================
CMD: Whenever we want to execute any command to run the application  we use this instruction

Basic concept of docker
=======================
Whenever we are installing any software, we are downloading the software and running .exe file. and that .exe file container everything
