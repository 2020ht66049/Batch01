Docker
======
>>> Whenever we are getting any instruction to deploy application, development team specify the dependancy-

Example: 
git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
cd spring-petclinic
./mvnw package
java -jar target/*.jar

Petclinic is a Spring Boot application built using Maven or Gradle. You can build a jar file and run it from the command line (it should work just as well with Java 17 or newer):


So, when we setup the environment we need to install those dependancies

from ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt install git -y
RUN git clone https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic.git
WORKDIR spring-petclinic
RUN ./mvnw clean package -DskipTests
CMD java -jar target/*.jar

from <os-name>
RUN <Instruction1>
RUN <Instruction2>
RUN <Instruction3>
RUN <Instruction4>
RUN <Instruction5>
CMD <last command>

Note: if RUN cd come then replace it with workdir






Writing docker file rule:
=========================
1) The instruction should be from <OS-name> where you want to deploy the application
      FROM ubuntu, centos, alpine
      from ubuntu
      from centos
      from aline

2) I want to print some message on linux terminal
      command: echo "Message"
      Docker-Command-keyword echo messase

Dockerfile
==========
It contains set of instruction to create docker image
from <os name>
cmd echo "message"

How to create docker image?
==========================
docker build -t imagename .

How to run docker image
=======================
docker run imagename  

Docker-Command-keyword
======================
RUN: it used to install required software
WORKDIR > RUN cd
FROM: It is used to choose the OS image.
CMD: Whenever we want to execute any command to run the application  we use this instruction
ENTRYPOINT:
veryimpotant point[CMD means argument can be overwritted, but in entrypoint it's fixed.
entrypoint cmd
ping google.com
ping yahoo.com
ping localhost



Basic concept of docker
=======================
Whenever we are installing any software, we are downloading the software and running .exe file. and that .exe file container everything

My requirement is-

You need to tell me 2 things-
a) Containt of docker file.
b) command to create docker image.
c) Command to write docker image.

1) Print hello message by ubuntu linux, and save it as image21:ubuntu
Dockerfile:
from ubuntu
cmd echo "Hello" 
creating image: docker build -t image21:ubuntu .[current working directory]
running image: docker run image21:ubuntu
     
2) Print Namaste by alpine linux, and save it as image21:alpine
Dockerfile:
from alpine
cmd echo Namaste
creating image:docker build -t image21:alpine .
running image: docker run image21:alpine

3) Print bye by centos linux, and save it as image21:centos
Dockerfile: 
from centos
cmd echo bye
creating image: docker build -t image21:centos .
running image: docker run image21:centos

4) Create a docker image to print "Welcome to Docker world" in alpine linux.
      from alpine
      cmd echo "Welcome to Docker world"

      docker build -t umesh[name of image] .
      docke run umesh


5) from ubuntu
   cmd echo "Who are you?"


6) from ubuntu
   cmd echo "Who are you?"
   cmd echo "Where are you?"

Homework

Task create docker image with name terraform to deploy below intruction in ubuntu image
========================================================================================
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform
