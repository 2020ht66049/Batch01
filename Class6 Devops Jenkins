Pipeline
=========
Pipeline is a set of stages to perform any activity.

My requirement: I want to deploy spring pet clinic application

Task1: Create Environment and install softwares
                  [Infrastucture Speciliast]

Task2: Application Deployment
                  [Deployment Engineer]

Task3: Testing [Tester]


pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Infrasture creation') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('Deployment') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}




>>> Communication between developer, tester and deployment Engineer's are done by mail/ticket, and we may have some delay.

>>> To avoid this delay we have concept of pipeline.

>>> to create pipeline we need to install jenkisn
