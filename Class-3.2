Maven life cycle
=================
./mvnw <goal-of-maven>

1) validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
2) compile - compile the source code of the project
3) test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
4) package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
5) verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
6) install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
7) deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
